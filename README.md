## Assignment
You have formed groups of roughly 6 people each. You need to create an
educational game suitable for children aged 11-14 years. It is up to you what
game you decide to do. The game can be 2D or 3D. It must be developed
using Unity. However, the main assessment criteria are based on how you
work as a group. Thus, it is not the final product that is of concern â€“ though
there must be some final product to get a mark. You will need to learn to use
Git, plan your project, and develop it based on use cases and tests. Make
sure not to spend more time on this project than it deserves for marks. That
means you do a total of 50 hours work each over the period which should
leave you with a simple playable game at a minimum.
