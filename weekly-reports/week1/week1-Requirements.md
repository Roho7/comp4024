## Project Management Requirements:

1.  **Scope Definition:** Clear definition of the game's scope, including a list of must-have versus nice-to-have features to manage time effectively.
2.  **Development Timeline:** A detailed schedule allocating time for design, development, testing, and refinement phases within the 2-week period.
