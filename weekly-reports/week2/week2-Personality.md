## Decided Team Roles

To descide upon our final team roles, we have used the results of the personality test, personal prefernce, and past work/degree experince. This has led to two main catagories: designing aspects for the game, and implementing the design. This is not a hard border and group members will be free to work on different sections. We belive that combining expeirnces of diffrent team members will facilitate the best result, so we are considering the use of paired programmin to allow the less confident coders to still have input on the implementation of the design.
