# Minimum Viable Product

## The Brief:

The Brief of this project is the creation of an interactive learning game for children of the ages 11-14, who will be in their first years of seccondary school in the UK. The game must, have key learning objectives imbedded into the gameplay cycle and must be designed in a way to keep the player encaged and receptive to learning.

> Who are your target users?

The projects target users are children aged between 11 years old and 14 years old.

> What is the top pain point your users are experiencing?

Children of this age often find learning about, and putting into practice differnt concepts taught to them boring. This lack of motivation is often caused by the feeling that the topics learnt are not useful, or finding exam style practice questions tedious.

## Scope of MVP

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will consist of a 2D platformer game that has 3 levels, each with 1-2 questions for students to answer. There will be a selection screen which allows the player to choose what level they would like to play. Each level will be populated with enemies. A set of maths questions will be made that are suitable for the age group and cover a variety of relevant topics in varying levels of difficulty.

Importantly, the software will work in such a way that it can easily be extended, by creating new levels in the scene builder and adding them to the main menu. The questions will not be hard coded, and will allow the importing of different question sets on different subjects and and topics into the game.
