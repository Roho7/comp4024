# Week 4 Overview

## Retrospective:

### What Went Well

- Refactor of player class to allow for more maintainble and streamlined code, also allows for easier testing.

- Implementation of unity tests as opposed to Debug.Log testing for future scalability.

- Better use of burndown allowed for understanding between sub teams and parallelisation of work.

- More art assets created, for different level backgrounds, and sprits needed for polished gameplay.

- Implementation of animated player, collaberation between art and coding teams.

### What Went Wrong And how might it be addressed

- Migrating to unit testing took longer than expected to complete.

- Implementation of dynamic question loading was unable to be completed due to scheduling issue with Leo.

- Difficulty experinced by the design team learning how to place prefabs to create levels, workshop will be held together to create a level as a group.


### Sprint Backlog

- Healthbar system for enemy damage.
- Attempt system for answering questions.
- Score tracking feature for beating enemies and answering questions.
- Dynamically loading questions from file.

### What Does This Mean For Next Week

- We will hold a workshop for everyone in the group, we will create a level together so that everyone can learn how to do it. We will then be able to individually create levels.

- As a group we have decided to create 'scaffolding' so that those on the team with less programming experience can contribute to the level creation in unity - this will potentially be done by creating a tile map system.

- After reviewing the Burn Down chart we have noticed that documentation / admin / meetings takes longer than we anticipate, and so we will be allocating them more time.
