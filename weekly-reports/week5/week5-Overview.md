## Retrospective:

### What Went Well

- New use of 'Live Share' made mob programming much easier. This also allowed us to search for bugs in the game together.

- Good teamwork to implement new level and assets.

- Making a unit testing scene made making tests easier.

- Implementation of multiople key featurs.



### What Went Wrong And how might it be addressed

- Slight misunderstanding meant some of the final documentation was left too late, but worked well as a team to account for this.

- Had to resolve a large merge conflict, to prevent this in the future we should reduce problem size so that branches an be merged more frequently.

- We were unable to complete all features we wanted to for the week:
    - Hint system
    - Enemy Animation
    - seperate score for questions answered.
    - Bonus questions in levels.
