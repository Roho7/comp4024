# Project Post-Mortem Document

## Project Overview

### Math Quest:
- **Project Duration:** 01/02/2024 - 07/03/2024 (5 Sprints)
- **Brief Project Description:** This project aimed to make a maths educational 2d platformer game in Unity for children aged 11 - 14.

## Final Scope:
- Included Features:
  - Main menu screen with level selector
  - Three different levels
  - Player movement (Left, Right, Jump, Shoot)
  - Enemy Movement (restricted path)
  - Player animation for movement
  - Player animation of death if collison with enemy or trap (e.g. fire)
  - Game Over screen
  - Question Block that asks a maths question to remove barrier to next level
  - Dynamically loading questions based on difficulty from a JSON file
  - Level and Player design
- Excluded Features (and reason for exclusion):
  - Hints for the user for exchange of their points we were not able to achieve this feature due to our scope being too large for our time frame
  - Health for the player we were not able to achieve this feature due to our scope being too large for our time frame
  - Creating a tilemap for easy production of levels this was not achieved due to our scope being too large for our time frame

## Timeline and Milestones

- **Planned Timeline and Milestones:**
  - Complete basic level logic by 2nd sprint
  - Complete player and enemy movement by 3rd sprint
  - Create menu logic by 3rd sprint
  - Get the all the design and sprites made by the 3rd sprint
  - Get dynamic loaded questions done by 4th sprint
  - Create Score logic, enemy and player death by 4th sprint
  - Create game over screen and music/SFX by 5th sprint
  - Integrate the design into the levels by 5th sprint
- **Actual Timeline and Milestones:**
    - Complete basic level logic was achieved on the 2nd sprint
  - Complete player and enemy movement was achieved 3rd sprint
  - Create menu logic was achieved by the 3rd sprint
  - Get the all the design and sprites was achieved on the 4th sprint
  - Get dynamic loaded questions was achieved on the 4th sprint
  - Create Score logic, enemy and player death was achieved on the 4th sprint
  - Create game over screen and music/SFX was achieved on the 5th sprint
  - Integrate the design into the levels was achieved on the 5th sprint

## Lessons Learned

- **Lesson 1:**

  - We felt that our scope was too large as were not able to implement some features due to time restraints and underestimating how long some tasks woul take

- **Lesson 2:**

  - Had a few problems with assigning tasks to team members as some were redundently done as multiple people or not picked up at all

## Recommendations for Future Projects

- **Recommendation 1:**

  - Make the scope more achievable within the time frame avaliable to us by focusing on more indepth features rather than a high quantity of features.

- **Recommendation 2:**

  - Even tho our team being of a low number of people we should assigned less broad roles and appropriate leadership within the team, rather than the democratic approach we took.
